## Setting up and testing

Your first step will be to assemble the parts of your buggy and test that you can control each of the motors.

- Have a look at the section below to see how to assemble the physical hardware needed for this project.

- Once you have assembled the hardware and your Raspberry Pi is powered up, you can test that the motors are both working.

- Have a look at the section below to see how you can control the motors using Python.
