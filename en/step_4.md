## Assemble your robot

There is no right way to build your prototype robot chassis, but there are a few things to bear in mind:

- The chassis needs to house the Raspberry Pi, motor controller, and batteries.
- The chassis needs to allow the mounting of a pair of wheels.
- You may want to later add a couple of line sensors, and an ultrasonic distance sensor or a lidar sensor to the chassis.

It's always a good idea to build a prototype chassis first. Eventually, you can learn how to laser-cut or 3D print a chassis, but in this project, a cardboard box is used as a temporary solution.

The first step is to place your motors into the chassis. 

--- task ---
Place your motors inside the box, in roughly the position that you would like them to sit. Then use a pen to mark the place where the motors' axle will need to pass through the walls of the box. Make sure you are giving your wheels enough room to spin around.

Use a sharp object to poke holes through the sides of the box so that the motors' axles can fit through.

You will need to fix the motors in place. Use an adhesive putty or tape to hold them down.

Once the motors are in place, you can attach the wheels to the axles.

When the wheels are in place, you can screw a ball caster to the front of the container to act as a third wheel.

If you're using a power bank, you can now power up your Raspberry Pi. If you want to make your own power bank, then follow the guide below.

To use your Raspberry Pi without connecting a mouse, monitor, or keyboard, you can remotely access it via SSH or VNC.
