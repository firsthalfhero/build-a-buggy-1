## Assemble your robot

There is no *right* way to build your prototype robot chassis, but there are a few things to bare in mind:

- The chassis needs to house the Raspberry Pi and motor controller.
- The chassis needs to also carry the batteries for the motor controller and the Raspberry Pi.
- The chassis needs to allow the mounting of a pair of wheels.
- You may want to later add a couple of line sensors and the ultrasonic distance sensor or lidar to the chassis.

It's always a good idea to build a prototype chassis first. In a later project, you can learn how to laser-cut or 3D print a chassis, but in this project, a cardboard box is used as a temporary solution.

The first step is to place your motors into the chassis. 

--- task ---
Place your motors inside the box, in roughly the position that you would like them to sit. Then use a pen to mark the place where the motors' axle will need to pass through the walls of the box.

Use a sharp object to poke holes through the sides of the box, so that the motors' axles can fit through.

You will need to fix the motors in place. Use an adhesive putty or tape to hold them down.

Once the motors are in place, you can attach the wheels to the axles.

With the wheels in place a ball castor can be screwed to the front of the container to act as a third wheel.

If you're using a power bank, you can now power up your Raspberry Pi. If you are making your own power bank, then follow the guide below

To use your Raspberry Pi, without connecting a mouse, monitor or keyboard, you can use SSH or VNC to remotely access it.
